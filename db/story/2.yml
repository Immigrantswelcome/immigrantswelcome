    "There came a time when I graduated - no more school days - and for some reason
    I cannot quite understand - it seemed to be taken for granted that I should go
    to the U.S.A. Perhaps because my father used to go there regularly and used to
    bring home such things as American fruit and nuts and newspapers. So I went.
    And here I am."


    These words were written by my great-grandmother Rudolpha Catherine Rigelsen,
    who immigrated to the U.S. from her home in Antwerp, Belgium on June 20, 1909
    aged 22 years and 9 months. She left behind behind four siblings (Pauline, Julie,
    Kamma and Rachilde) as well as her mother and father (Pauline Petersen of Borre,
    Vestfold, Norway and Rudolph August Hanssen Rigelsen, also of Norway). Her father
    was a sea captain who at one time had sailed the largest vessel out of a Norwegian
    port around the seven seas.


    As Rudolpha was a talented musician and artist (her craft was millinery), she
    quickly found work as a governess for the three children of Clarence Mackay,
    a second-generation Irish-American financier and the chairman of the board of
    the Postal Telegraph and Cable Corporation. Mackay himself had "struck it rich"
    as a young man by discovering the single largest lode of silver ore in the world.
    He proceeded to marry the debutante daughter of an old, high society, New York
    family and build a 600+ acre, 50-room estate in Roslyn NY - said to be the
    largest "summer house" of the era.


    While I don't know for sure how long Rudolpha stayed with the Mackays, the fact
    that she married my great-grandfather - the famed science-fiction illustrator
    Frank R. Paul  - in 1913 tells me that she probably left the Mackay family at
    that time to be with her new husband. She must have missed the Mackay children
    as I've inherited some beautiful portraits of them that were gifted to her by
    their mother. When the one of the girls - Ellin - married Irving Berlin, a Jew,
    Ellin was disinherited. I have since wondered if this act didn't leave Ruldolpha
    with a distaste for intolerance, which she seems to have tried to pass on to her
    children and grandchildren before she died. In her own words:


    "Please don't even be BIGOTED Americans. The world holds many other peoples -
    all equally important, especially to the Creator of us all. And yet, please
    don't be the kind of white Americans who can learn to "despise" their own race
    - or who can let other races (despise or hate it enough to) induce you to go to
    war against your own in some other country and thereby commit a kind of suicide.
    Please work of Peace. For you -- my little ones -- have even more roots than my
    four children, who are your parents."
