    I came to the United States in 2011 from Poland.


    After obtaining PhD degree in Biochemistry I started looking for a job in my field.
    My boss convinced me to look in US, as this is the country of great opportunities
    especially for scientists. I did not look for long and I can say that the job found me.
    A PI (Principal Investigator) from Thomas Jefferson University was looking for someone
    with exactly my qualifications and he contacted my PhD thesis advisor about me.


    Shortly after I agreed to accept a postdoctoral position, I got DS-2019* form and
    I had a meeting at the US embassy in Poland. I got a J-1 visa for 5 years without
    any problems. I came to Philadelphia the last day of March 2011 and the next day
    I started work at TJU.


    After almost 3.5 years there my PI lost the founding for the project I was working on
    and that resulted in termination of my visa. I was obligated to leave the US within
    1 month. Luckily for me I was already married to a US citizen and I didn't have to
    leave the country. I still was waiting for a decision about a green card and finding
    a new job in these circumstances was much more difficult than finding job here when
    I was still in Poland.


    I crossed the ocean to start a new life in a different country, on a different continent.
    There was no cultural shock but there were a few things that were different from what I
    was used to. Some of them were annoying some were a pleasant surprise. It took some time
    to adjust to those small differences. Thanks to great people I met here I didnâ€™t feel
    alienated and could always count on their help.


    I immigrated to the US, the country that holds the lead in science and technology to work
    with the best and to develop as a scientist. My scientific career here was not what I
    expected. But I met my husband and started a new family.
