heroTitle: Immigrants Welcome!
heroText: >
    President Trump wants us to believe immigrants are dangerous to our country, but we know
    better. Immigrants are our neighbors, friends, classmates, and coworkers. We will not be divided by
    religion or nationality, and we will not be silent when members of our community are
    attacked. We stand against immigration policies based on hate and fear.


    Stand with us to show Washington that immigrants are welcome!—on DATE “Immigrants Welcome!”
    will deliver your signature to Congress and the White House alongside thousands of stories
    from American immigrants. Our stories will show policymakers the truth, we are not
    afraid — immigrants are welcome!

    Immigrants are in danger. It’s time to defend our neighbors. On February 28th companies,
    websites, youtubers, faith groups, organizations, and individuals will come together to say
    that “Immigrants are welcome here!” We’ll flood social media—and the desks of policymakers in
    Washington—with our own immigrant stories, and demand an end to attacks on immigrants and
    refugees.
